MU is the amplification factor, 

EX (typical range from 1.3 to 1.4, but see below)

kG1 is a factor used to fit the equation to data (for anode current)

kG2 is a constant similar in function to kG1 (for screen current, pentode)

KP (kP) (behaviour region (A), see below)

KVB ("knee" of the characteristic curves, see below)

CCG cap. cathode to grid,

CPG cap. plate to grid,

CCP cap. cathode to plate.

EG is control grid voltage, 

EP is plate voltage, 

IP is plate current, (product)

EG2 is screen grid voltage 

IG2 is the screen grid current (product)

RGI is the grid-to-cathode resistance that controls grid current when EG > 0. (No grid current flows during 
normal operation, when EG < 0.) The numbers in Table 1 are rough estimates based on measurements of similar 
tubes in old texts.3 Good up-to-date data is very scarce, and would be most welcome.

KP (kP) dominates the behavior of the new model in region (A), which is characterized by large negative grid 
voltage, large plate voltage, and low plate current. Plate current is inversely proportional to KP in this 
region. Determining KP for a given tube is done entirely by trial-and-error. Triode-mode curves must be used 
to obtain an accurate estimate of KP for pentodes because published pentode curves tend to have insufficient
resolution in region (A). 
3/2 = 1.5 (!)

KVB (kVB) relates to the "knee" of the characteristic curves, and is defined differently in the triode and 
pentode equations. For pentodes, the knee is proportional to KVB, and is most visible in the pentode-mode 
curves (Figure 3 for the 6550). Equation (5) does not give an accurate estimate of the knee for all levels 
of grid voltage, EG. Fortunately, this is not a serious limitation because load lines for practical designs 
pass close to the knee for EG = 0. (Otherwise there would be a serious impedance mismatch.) The location of 
the knee for EG = 0 was used to determine KVB in Table 1. For triodes, the knee is proportional to the square 
root of KVB, and is only apparent when the tube is operated with positive grid voltage.

EX ~ To determine EX and KG1 (X and kG1), run the appropriate plate curve program (Appendix A1 or A2), and 
observe plate current I(VP) using Probe. Adjust EX and KG1 so that curves for relatively low negative grid 
voltages (e.g., Vg = 0 or -0.5 for the 12AX7 in Figure 2) match experimental data. Typical values of EX range 
from 1.3 to 1.4. Line curvature increases with EX. The textbook value of 3/2 for EX is appropriate for 
equations (1) and (2), where it gives a reasonable average representation of tube operation, but is not 
really accurate in all regions. KG1 is inversely proportional to plate current for given grid and plate 
voltages. It usually requires several runs to get a really good match for EX and KG1. MU may need to be 
adjusted slightly in the process.
